# Blog Style Guide

## Writing Style Overview

The blog maintains a conversational, technical writing style that balances accessibility with depth. The tone is informal yet informative, using first-person narrative to create a personal connection with readers while explaining complex technical concepts. The writing demonstrates a preference for:

- **Clear, structured explanations** with logical progression from simple to complex concepts
- **Personal reflection and storytelling** that contextualizes technical achievements within human experience
- **Visual aids and examples** to support written explanations
- **Honest assessment** of both successes and limitations
- **Detailed technical depth** without sacrificing readability
- **Numbered sections and subsections** for easy navigation
- **Footnotes** for additional context and tangential information

## Key Stylistic Elements

### Structure and Organization
- Posts use numbered hierarchical sections (1., 1.1., 1.2., etc.)
- Each post includes a table of contents (`toc: true`)
- Complex topics are broken down into digestible subsections
- Examples and case studies are used extensively to illustrate concepts

### Tone and Voice
- Conversational and accessible, avoiding overly academic language
- Self-deprecating humor and honest reflection on mistakes/limitations
- Direct engagement with the reader using "we," "you," and "our"
- Enthusiasm for technical subjects balanced with realistic assessment

### Technical Writing Conventions
- Code examples are provided in clearly formatted blocks
- Pseudocode is used to focus on algorithmic concepts rather than implementation details
- Performance metrics and specific measurements are included
- Visual diagrams and figures support explanations
- Footnotes provide additional context without disrupting flow

## Illustrative Examples

### From "GBA Jam 2024"

**Example 1: Personal reflection with technical context**
> "As this was my first project for the GBA, and my first time using C++, my personal goal was simply to make something of high enough quality to submit. Overall, we both had a great time and we're already excited for the next one."

**Example 2: Conversational explanation of technical concepts**
> "We used the dialogue system everywhere we could to save time, even some of the puzzles are powered by a mixture of dialogue and puzzle specific code."

**Example 3: Honest assessment with specific details**
> "There was only 1 bug that we were aware of: missing collision on one wall allowing you to clip into another room. We simply ran out of time to fix it. Fortunately, this didn't allow any sequence breaks and was mainly a polish issue."

### From "Revisiting AoC 2022"

**Example 1: Engaging introduction with personal narrative**
> "After hearing about AoC from some friends in 2022, I decided to give it a go. About halfway through I came across a problem which I thought was particularly interesting: Day 15: Beacon Exclusion Zone. It's now more than a year later, AoC 2023 has long concluded, and I'm finally getting around to publishing this... better late than never!"

**Example 2: Clear technical explanation with concrete examples**
> "Easy... except it takes 3.5 days to run. Better than solving by hand, but still not good enough."

**Example 3: Thoughtful analysis with specific performance metrics**
> "I found this approach surprisingly effective, the runtime has gone from approximately 3.5 days to 199ms on my machine, a factor of 1.5×10⁶ improvement."

## Content Guidelines

### Technical Posts Should Include
- Personal motivation or context for the project
- Clear problem definition with examples
- Step-by-step progression through solution approaches
- Performance measurements and comparisons
- Honest reflection on what worked and what didn't
- Visual aids (diagrams, code blocks, etc.)
- Acknowledgments and credits where appropriate

### Language Conventions
- Use contractions for conversational tone ("we'd," "I'll," "it's")
- Employ rhetorical questions to engage readers
- Include parenthetical asides for additional context
- Use specific numbers and measurements rather than vague terms
- Acknowledge limitations and areas for improvement
- Credit sources of inspiration or collaboration

### Formatting Standards
- Code blocks should specify language for syntax highlighting
- Figures should include descriptive captions
- Complex topics warrant their own subsections
- Footnotes provide additional detail without disrupting main narrative
- Performance comparisons should include specific metrics and context
